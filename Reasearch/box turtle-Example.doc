Ornate box turtle
--------------------------------------------------

Summary
--------------------------------------------------
terrapene ornata ornata is a terrestrial species of turtle native to the great plains of the united states. it is one of two different subspecies of the terrapene ornata. it's the state reptile of kansas. it is currently listed as threatened in illinois and is protected in six midwestern states illinois colorado iowa nebraska kansas and wisconsin. 


== Distribution and habitat ==
--------------------------------------------------
the geographic distribution of the ornate box turtle covers a large part of the midwest from wisconsin to the gulf of mexico and from louisiana to colorado. it was first discovered in 1795 in nebraska where a large number of them were found. The turtle is usually found in grasslands and on land rather than in water; they have been found in all habitat types of the Great Plains except aquatic, though most references indicate they prefer open grass or prairie lands.. several studies indicate that the ornate box turtle requires three specific types of microhabitats to survive. 

== Diet ==
--------------------------------------------------
the ornate box turtle is an omnivore with no specific dietary preferences as an opportunistic feeder it eats whatever is available in any given place or season. Grasses, berries, insects and other invertebrates (caterpillars, grasshoppers, beetles, earthworms), fruits, vegetables, and carrion (mammals, birds, amphibians, snakes, and even other turtles).. this varied diet means the turtle has very little competition for food resources available. 

== Lifespan ==
--------------------------------------------------
the ornate box turtle's lifespan was reported to be from 32 to 37 years with studies showing that males are about half as common as females. The reason for the predominance of females is thought to be primarily due to temperature; incubating eggs at 29 °C (84 °F) produces 100% female offspring, so in the wild a combination of temperature, humidity, and other factors are thought to favor female differentiation.Birds, such as crows, raptors, and ravens; domestic cats and dogs; opossums; raccoons; skunks; snakes; and even adult box turtles; are potential predators of young turtles.. The turtle has very little means of self-defense other than closing the shell, though they may potentially bite if handled.Until recently, there was very little scientific knowledge of diseases and parasites among the turtle populations; early studies showed that a genus of fly sometimes infested the legs of these turtles and caused death by starvation because their movement was impeded.. more recently it has been found that respiratory metabolic and shell diseases common in desert tortoises also fairly common in land turtles such as the ornate box turtle and that nutritional deficiencies contribute to these other diseases the age of ornate box turtles has been estimated for many years by counting growth rings. the estimate of the age of a tree is similar but for turtles the rings are lines that form on a part of the shell that are like scales and the longer a turtle lives the more rings are formed. However, using the rings to estimate age is not always reliable.. as turtles grow older the shell increases in size even though its weight makes it heavy to carry. 

== Conservation efforts ==
--------------------------------------------------
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the ornate box turtle is "near threatened." In some states, such as Nebraska, Kansas, and Colorado, the turtle is "secure"; but in South Dakota, it is listed as "imperiled"; and in Wyoming it is listed as "critically imperiled." Management decisions for the ornate box turtle are difficult because of life history factors.. it seems that the best strategies will be aimed at older females to increase their survival rather than focusing on hatchlings and juvenile turtles. One of the first things that needs to be done is to get a better idea of the actual number of ornate box turtles that exist and also to make it illegal to collect any for pet or commercial trade, as some states did.it is also necessary to end the release of captive box turtles that have respiratory infections because of the effect of disease on survival. management techniques that preserve the best habitat composition are important conservation practicesprobably the biggest factor that affects the ornate box turtle are interactions with humans so any action that minimizes contact is helpful. it is also helpful to maintain large areas of habitat open. it is important to know what chemicals are in the herbicide and how they affect turtles. the use of fire and mowing to control weeds should be carefully done when turtles are inactive or are located in burrows to keep cool. it is unlikely that the public would want to stop collecting turtles even if the pet trade is banned because people like to look at turtles and other forms of nature. nebraska and louisiana have banned the collection of ornate box turtles but neither new mexico nor texas.
